A simple Calculator Application using React JS.

This application uses React JS component oriented UI creation paradigm. All components are written in JSX and ES6 style and are combined using Webpack 5 to get the build App.

Babel is used to transpile all JSX code to vanilla JavaScript code. States and Props are used to pass data within components.

For calculation of all the expressions eval is used.

For UI creation HTML5 and CSS are used. Flex, the new feature of CSS3 is used for layout creation purpose.
